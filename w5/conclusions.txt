With random data set
All 3 pivot choices perform equally well with the timing incresing by 4 times when compared to 10k and 20k
and then doubling when the data set is doubled when compared to 20k and 40k
Since all 3 pivots return a random pivot the timings arent so different

With Reverse data set
The Random Quicksort seems to perform the best compared to the 3 choices with MT close behind
The Naive pivot performed the worse since it takes the worst case scenario 
The Naive pivot performs almost close to O(N^2) increaments in the timings
The MT Pivot doubles in timing as the data set doubles
The Random Pivot is almost linear in timing when compared to 10k and 20k (0.75)
but almost quadruples when compared to 20k to 40k (3.33)

With Ordered data set
Again the Random Quicksort seems to perform the best overall but gives the same result as the MT pivot in the 40k category
As expected the Naive piovt performs the worst because it takes the worst case scenario
In the timings the MT pivot doubles in timing as data set doubles
The Random Pivot quadruples in timing as the data set doubles.

Which is fair to say that for larger data sets the MT pivot will eventually perform better than the Random Pivot.
In both the Reverse and Ordered data set
