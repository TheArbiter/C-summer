Assignment 2 diary

25/01
Went through all the files to get a rough understanding
Worked on the lab graph.c file since the code was almost the same
Wrote a few black box test for testGraph.c

26/01 
started working on graph.c 
the two implementation choices were between a list and matrix
chose matrix since accessibility is easy compared to traversing a list
Worked on the first few functions

28/01
Finished the functions given in the graph.c file
Have to decide if I need to add any other functions will decide later

31/01
Working on main file
Have to add extra function to graph file to store info in the graph
Added function cityInfo
Now to start on agent.c and finish the random strategy
Random Strat done needed a few if statments 
but have a few problems when in display that need to be fixed

03/02
started working on stage 1 Cheapest Least Visited
using it as a static function
done upto finding edges and adding them to the array
and finding the minimum weight

04/02
Problems in display fixed in tut
Note to self dont make files in windows and then transfer to unix
Problem was the ^M at the end of each line in the files 
hence not displaying correct details on screen
Adding the edges visited with the minimum weight to an array
and then choosing which path based on the smallest vertex

06/02
finished cheapest least Visited
Fixing memory leaks
Started on DFS 
tried to see if I could just copy the dfs functions I wrote in lab 7 over to the graph.c file
got a little complicated so I just ended up adding the dfs functions in the agent.c file
Had to make a few tweaks to the function but not much of difference
Made another static function for the DFSstrat like the Cheapest Least Visited
Finished stage 2 of DFS and fixed memory leaks
Also when testing Stage 0 noticed that I havent implemented the map command properly yet
So have to work on that tomorrow
Also had to fix remaining agents files that had the ^M using vi

07/02
Map command stuff fixed
Started on Stage 3 least turns
Taking Queue Files from lab 2 for this strategy
Updated makeNextMove so that it could switch back to the original strategy if there is no thief in the location
If I can finish Least Turns startegy by today will start on Bonus part to cover up for the loss in the prac exam

08/02
Having problems on DFS not sure why
its not passing the dry run test but passes the test showed in the spec
Finished implementing least turns using a queue to get the shortest path
Also added a nodes.c file 

09/02
Implemented thief bonus stuff
Changed Makefile to fit the bonus
DFS still not working not sure why
FIXED DFS :D actually problem was not in DFS it was in the main file
The dry run test was actually checking stage 3 and not stage 2 wasted so much time trying to figure out what was wrong
Had to add a simple for loop in the main function of main.c to check and see if there were informants before game started
